Some "code inside" before renaming file4.txt


Renaming file4.txt to file4444.txt and changing content of the file

If you need to rename file:
1st step: rename file withnout changing content of the file and
then make one of three options, so than git knows that file was renamed:
	1) git add .
	2) git add file4.txt
		and then
	   git add file4444.txt
	3) git add file4.txt file4444.txt
After you moved file to the staging area make separate commit.


2nd step: If you need to make some changes inside the file,
make changes after you commited file with changed file name.
